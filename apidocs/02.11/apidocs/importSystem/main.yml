        the first QGM cluster the tdqg-node service is configured to serve. The Secondary QGM clusters are always added after 
        the tdqg-node service has been configured with a Primary QGM cluster. The tdqg-node software version selected by the secondary 
        QueryGrid Manager cluster has no effect. The secondary QGM cluster cannot run pre-02.09 versions of the QueryGrid fabric.
