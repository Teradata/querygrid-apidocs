    clusterOption:
      description: Cluster option for the host QGM cluster. Applicable for QueryGrid version 02.11+. The primary QGM cluster determines 
        the version of the tdqg-node software to run on the data nodes and can run pre-02.09 versions of the QueryGrid fabric. It is always 
        the first QGM cluster the tdqg-node service is configured to serve. The Secondary QGM clusters are always added after 
        the tdqg-node service has been configured with a Primary QGM cluster. The tdqg-node software version selected by the secondary 
        QueryGrid Manager cluster has no effect. The secondary QGM cluster cannot run pre-02.09 versions of the QueryGrid fabric.
